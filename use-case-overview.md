# Use Case Overview

In this workshop we will create a Procurement process that manages the process of ordering a new asset like a phone or laptop.
- The process is triggered when the Procurement department creates an order request
- The Supplier then sends an offer stating its best offer
- The urgency of the order determines the tolerance for price, obviously orders of high urgency have a higher price tolerance
- Depending on the urgency of the order and the price, the order can be auto-approved by a decision in the process
- If the order can not be auto-approved, a purchasing manager needs to complete a manual approval step
