# Process Modelling (40 mins)

- **Red Hat Process Automation Manager (RH PAM)** uses the [BPMN2](https://www.omg.org/bpmn/) standard to define the structure and semantics of the process
- With the data model defined, we can now sketch out the main flow of the process, the actors, the user task nodes and the required automation decisions
- Our use case has three main scenarios
 - Auto-Approval
 - Manual-Approval
 - Rejection
- Let’s start by modeling the process flow for the Auto-Approval scenario

For the remainder part of this workshop we are going to refer to Red Hat Process Automation Manager by it’s short name **RH PAM**. 

---

- In **RH PAM** the finished **Auto-Approval** scenario will look something like this

### 1.3.1 Create OrderAsset process

- Use the **breadcrumb navigator** at the top-left of the screen to navigate back to our **procurement-process** project view

![BreadcrumbNav]({% image_path m1p7i3_BreadcrumbNav.png %})

- Click on the Add Asset button

![AddAsset]({% image_path m1p7i4_AddAsset.png %})

- In the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner, select Process

![AddProcessMenu]({% image_path m1p7i5_AddProcessMenu.png %})

- Click on the **Business Process** tile

![ProcessTile]({% image_path m1p7i6_ProcessTile.png %})

Name your process **OrderAsset**, and click on the **+OK** button

![AddProcessDialog]({% image_path m1p7i7_AddProcessDialog.png %})

![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

It is common practice to use [Pascal](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase) case for business process names i.e. the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the first letter of each concatenated word is capitalized.

---

- The **OrderAsset** process opens in the **Process Designer**

![ProcessDesigner]({% image_path m1p7i8_ProcessDesigner.png %})

### 1.3.2 Define Process Variables

- Our process will manipulate two variables through it’s execution
 - The **OrderInfo** data object that we created in part 1.2 of this lab.
 - A bollean variable **approved**, that will hold the result of evaluating the supplier's offer
- Open the properties editor for our process
 - Firstly click your mouse anywhere on the blank canvas of the editing screen. This will ensure you are editing the properties of the entire process rather than the variables of one element.
 - hover on top right pencil icon in designer
 - click to open the **Properties pane** on the right
 
 ![PropertiesPane]({% image_path m1p7i9_PropertiesPane.png %})

- Scroll down in the property panel on the right side of the screen, until you see the section Process Data.
![ProcessVariables]({% image_path m1p7i10_ProcessVariables.png %})

![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

HINT: Don’t see a process data screen like this? 
If you see something that looks like the screen below, then you will need to select the BPMN canvas. Just click your mouse anywhere in that blank on the editing grid.

![WrongProperties]({% image_path m1p7i11_WrongProperties.png %})

---

- Expand the **Process Data** section
- Next click on the plus sign ‘+’ to define a new process variable

![AddProcessVariable]({% image_path m1p7i12_AddProcessVariable.png %})

Define a process variable as shown in the following table

|      Name     |    Data Type   |  
| ------------- | -------------- |
|   orderInfo   |   OrderInfo    |    
|   approved    |    Boolean     |    

![ProcessVariable]({% image_path m1p7i13_ProcessVariable.png %})



### 1.3.3 Create Swim Lanes

- In the palette on the left-side of the editor, click on the **containers** icon then select the **Lane** component

![LaneMenu]({% image_path m1p7i14_LaneMenu.png %})

- To create a **Lane**, move your cursor to the canvas and click on an area to place the lane component on the canvas
- Double click on the lane to give it the name **Supplier**

![NameLane]({% image_path m1p7i15_NameLane.png %})



---
![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

You can resize a lane by clicking on it, and using the red dot at the bottom right.

![ResizeLane]({% image_path m1p7i16_ResizeLane.png %})

---

- Repeat the same process again to create two more lanes:
 - System
 - Purchasing Manager
 
- Your lanes should look like this

![SwimLanes]({% image_path m1p7i17_SwimLanes.png %})



### 1.3.4 Create Start Event

- In the palette on the left-side of the editor, click on the **Start Events** icon then select the **Start** node

![StartEventMenu]({% image_path m1p7i18_StartEventMenu.png %})

- Click again inside the Purchasing Manager lane to place a start node there

![StartEvent]({% image_path m1p7i19_StartEvent.png %})


---
![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

Clicking on a node/event displays a set of mini icons that you can use to configure the node/event or create the next task in the process. This is another way to add nodes/events in addition to the left side menu

![MiniIcons]({% image_path m1p7i20_MiniIcons.png %})

---

### 1.3.5 Create Request Offer user task

- Click on the **Start Event** node, and click **Create Task**
- Click on the task node again and using the configuration icon below it, convert this node into a **Usertask** by clicking on the **Convert Into User** mini icon
- Double Click on the node to give it the name **Request Offer**

![RequestOfferTask]({% image_path m1p7i21_RequestOfferTask.png %})

- With the **Request Offer** node selected Open the **Properties pane** for this node, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section
- Set the **Task Name** to: RequestOffer
- Set the **Subject** to: Request Offer for #{orderInfo.item}
- Click on the **+Add** button under **Actors** and choose **pamAdmin** (your user)

![pamAdmin]({% image_path m1p7i22_pamAdmin.png %})

- Click on the **+Add button** under **Groups** then expand the drop down list and click on **+New** 
- Type in the group name as **rest-all**, and then click on the check mark

![restAll]({% image_path m1p7i23_restAll.png %})

- Now select the new group rest-all you just created

![Actors_Groups]({% image_path m1p7i24_actors_groups.png %})

- The next step is to pass our process variable **orderInfo** to the **Request Offer** task (task input), this will hold the information that a user will provide in the **Request Offer** task and then return it to the process (task output) to be available for the next steps in the flow
- Click on the pencil icon under **Assignments**

![Assignments]({% image_path m1p7i25_assignments.png %})

- This generates a pop-up: **Request Offer Data I/O** dialog
- Click the **+Add** button next to **Data Inputs and Assignments** 
- Provide the input as follows:

![requestOfferInput]({% image_path m1p7i26_requestOfferInput.png %})

- You will only need to provide the Name, the Data Type and Source are selected from dropdown menus. You are selecting the OrderInfo data type and the orderInfo process variable that we created in previous steps.
- Now click the **+Add** button next to **Data Outputs and Assignments**
- Like you did before provide the input as follows and then click **Save**

![requestOfferOutput]({% image_path m1p7i27_requestOfferOutput.png %})

- Your **RequestOffer Data I/O** should look something like this:

![RequestOfferAssignments]({% image_path m1p7i28_RequestOfferAssignments.png %})


### 1.3.6 Create Prepare Offer user task

- Now that the **Purchasing Manager** has requested an offer, the next step in our process is that the chosen Supplier prepares an offer
- In the palette on the left-side of the editor, click on the **Tasks** icon then select the User task

![UserTaskMenu]({% image_path m1p7i29_UserTaskMenu.png %})

- Click within the **Supplier** lane to place the **User** task
- Double click to give it the name **Prepare Offer**

![PrepareOfferTas]({% image_path m1p7i30_PrepareOfferTask.png %})

- Click on the **Request Offer** task and click on the mini icon **Create Sequence Flow**
- Drag the sequence flow to connect the **Request Offer** task to the **Prepare Offer** task
- Click on the **Sequence Flow** to create a bending point
- Click on the bending point and drag it along tha canvas (across lanes) to shape the **Sequence Flow** as shown in the below screenshots

![PrepareOfferSequenceFlow]({% image_path m1p7i31_PrepareOfferSequenceFlow.png %})

- With the **Prepare Offer** node selected Open the **Properties** pane for this node, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section and set the the attributes as follows:
 - **Task Name**: PrepareOffer
 - **Subject**: Prepare Offer for #{orderInfo.item}
 - **Actors**: pamAdmin
 - **Groups**: rest-all
 - **Assignments**: As per the following tables
 
 **Prepare Offer Data Inputs**
 ![PrepareOfferInput]({% image_path m1p7i32_PrepareOfferInput.png %})
 
 **Prepare Offer Data Outputs**
 ![PrepareOfferOutput]({% image_path m1p7i33_PrepareOfferOutput.png %})
 
 - Your **Prepare Offer** properties should look something like this:
 
  ![PrepareOfferAssignments]({% image_path m1p7i34_PrepareOfferAssignments.png %})

### 1.3.7 Create AutoApproval business rule task 

- In this step we will create the task the calls the business rule to decide whether the order can be auto -approved or not
- In the palette on the left-side of the editor, click on the **Tasks** icon then select the Business Rule task

 ![businessRuleTaskMenu]({% image_path m1p7i35_businessRuleTaskMenu.png %})

- Click within the **System** lane to place the User task
- Double click to give it the name **Auto Approval**
- Click on the **Prepare Offer** task and click on the mini icon **Create Sequence Flow**
- Drag the sequence flow to connect the **Prepare Offer** task to the **Auto Approval** task and shape it like in the following screenshot

  ![AutoApprovalFlow]({% image_path m1p7i36_AutoApprovalFlow.png %})
  
- Open the **Properties** pane for this node, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section and set Rule language to DMN
- Now expand the **Data Assignments** section and provide the following assignments and then click the **Save** button

**Auto Approval Data Inputs**
![AutoApproveInput]({% image_path m1p7i37_AutoApproveInput.png %})

**Auto Approval Data Outputs**
![AutoApproveOutput]({% image_path m1p7i38_AutoApproveOutput.png %})

---
![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

After we ‘ve modeled our rules, we will revisit the configuration of this node to reference the rule we created

---


### 1.3.8 Create Check Auto Approval gateway

- We will now create a diverging bridge to allow the process to progress in one of two directions:
 - Auto Approval is true -> Go ahead an insert the order in the [Enterprise Resource System (ERP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning)
 - Auto Approval is false -> Assign the order to the **Purchasing Manager** for review 
- Click on the **Auto Approval** task to show it’s mini icons
- Click on **Create Parallel**
- Click on the newly created gateway to show it’s mini icons
- Use it’s configuration icon (the one below the gateway) to convert into an **Exclusive Gateway (X-OR)** by clicking on the **Convert Into Exclusive** icon
- Name this X-OR gate: **Check Auto Approval**

![CreateAutoApprovalTask]({% image_path m1p7i39_CreateAutoApprovalTask.png %})

### 1.3.9 Create Converge Approval gateway

- In this step we want to create converging gateway to allow the path coming from the auto approval and manual approval (that we will create in scenario 2) to converge at one end event
- Click on **Check Auto Approval** gateway to show it’s mini icons, click on the **Create Parallel** icon
- Convert the new gateway to an Exclusive Gateway (X-OR) and name it Converge Approval
- With the **Properties** pane open click on the **Sequence Flow** between the **Check Auto Approval** gateway and **Converge Approval** gateway, in the **Properties** pane give the Sequence Flow the name auto approved

![CreateConvergeApprovalGW]({% image_path m1p7i40_CreateConvergeApprovalGW.png %})


---
![Info]({% image_path m0_info.png %}){:align="left"} 

To open the **Diagram Properties** pane of a **Sequence Flow** without triggering its format feature (creating a binding point), click on it’s arrowhead instead of its body with the **Properties** pane already opened

---

### 1.3.10 Create Send to ERP end event

- Click on **Converge Approval** gateway to show it’s mini icons
- Click on Create End 
- Double click on the end event to name it **Send to ERP**

![CreateSendToERP]({% image_path m1p7i41_CreateSendToERP.png %})


We have now finished modeling our first scenario **Auto-Approval** and we will start modeling our second scenario **Manual-Approval**

![ManualApproveFlow]({% image_path m1p7i42_ManualApproveFlow.png %})

###  1.3.11 Create Manual Approval user task

- Using the left menu, create a **User Task** in the **Purchasing Manager** lane, under the **Check Auto Approval** gateway 
- Double Click on the user task and name it **Manual Approval** 
- Click on the **Check Auto Approval** gateway and use the **Create Sequence** Flow icon to Connect the **Check Auto Approval** gateway to the **Manual Approval** user task
- Name this Sequence Flow: **manual approval required**

![ManualApprovalRequired]({% image_path m1p7i43_ManualApprovalRequired.png %})

- Open the **Properties** pane for this task, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section to provide the following properties: 
 - **Task Name**: ApproveOffer
 - **Subject**: Approve Offer of #{orderInfo.item}
 - **Actors**: pamAdmin
 - **Groups**: rest-all
 - **Assignments**: As per the following tables

**Manual Approval Inputs**

![ManualApprovalInput]({% image_path m1p7i44_ManualApproveInput.png %})

**Manual Approval Outputs**

![ManualApprovalOutput]({% image_path m1p7i45_ManualApproveOutput.png %})

###  1.3.12 Create Check Manual Approval gateway

- We now want to create another **Exclusive Gateway (X-OR)** in the **Purchasing Manager** swimlane, after the ** Manual Approval** node.
- Click on the **Manual Approval** node, and then click on the the Create Parallel mini icon
- Hover over the settings icon under the gateway and click on **Convert into Exclusive** mini icon
- Name the X-OR gateway: **Check Manual Approval**

![CreateCheckManualApproval]({% image_path m1p7i46_CreateCheckManualApproval.png %})

- Click on the **Check Manual Approval** gateway to show it’s mini icons, click on **Create Sequence Flo**w and connect the **Check Manual Approval** gateway with the **Converge Approval gateway**
- Name the **Sequence flow** connecting the **Check Auto Approval** gateway and the **Converge Approval** gateway: **manually approved**

![ManuallyAprrovedSequence]({% image_path m1p7i47_ManuallyAprrovedSequence.png %})

- Select the **Check Auto Approval** gateway
- Open the Diagram properties pane, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section
- Set the **Default Route** property to **Manual Approval**

![CheckAutoApprovalDefaultRoute]({% image_path m1p7i48_CheckAutoApprovalDefaultRoute.png %})

- Open the **Diagram properties** pane for the **auto approved**  sequence flow, and expand the **Implementation/Execution** section
- We want to set the following condition, this path should be taken when the order is approved by the system:
 - **Process Variable**: approved
 - **Condition**: Is true

![AutoApproveCondition]({% image_path m1p7i49_AutoApproveCondition %})


---
![Tip]({% image_path m0_tip.png %}){:align="left"} 

It may seem counterintuitive at first, however the conditions for these X-OR statements don't go into the details on the Gateway properties, rather the conditions are placed on the sequence flows.  If you think that you are setting a direction path, and on that direction path line you are telling the system under what conditions it should go this way, and on the other pathway under what conditions the system should go that way - thinking of it this way makes it seem intuitive.

---

- Similarly set the following conditions for the manually approved sequence flow:
 - **Process Variable**: approved
 - **Condition**: Is true
 
 
We have now finished modeling our second scenario Manual-Approval and we will start modeling our final scenario Rejection

![RejectionFlow]({% image_path m1p7i50_RejectionFlow %})

###  1.3.13 Create Rejected end event

- Create an **End Event** node after the **Check Manual Approval** gateway and name it **Reject**.
- Select the **Check Manual Approve** gateway, and set it’s **Default Route** to **Reject**

![RejectionEndNode]({% image_path m1p7i51_RejectionEndNode %})


---
![Save]({% image_path m0_save.png %}){:align="left"} 

Remember to save your progress 

---

Your finished process diagram should like something like this


![FinalFlow]({% image_path m1p7i52_FinalFlow %})

With the overall layout of the process definition complete, the routing logic implemented, and the I/O assignments defined, we can now implement the business rules of our automated approval decision.
